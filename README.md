Toe-hook designs for electronic skateboards
This is a 3d printable toe-hook design for skateboarding. 1/4" x  1 1/4" bolts were used with T-nuts to lock the toe-hook in place. The base-plate bolt-holes are the same with as truck-mounting hardware. A 5/16" x 1 1/2" bolt was used to reinforce the the post. These haven't been diligently tested yet so please be careful if you use them.
